	To complile LibFS, in the directory where LibFS.c is located, run the following:
	
		$ make libFS.so
			
	To compile the included test programs with LibFS and LibDisk, run:
	
		$ make 
		
			
Set environment variables:
	Before running a program, you must add the shared library to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH/
	To do this run:
	
		$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.

	To link with this library, you simply specify the base name of the library with "-lDisk" and "-lFS" and the path
	to find the library "-L." (the current directory). To do this, run:
	
		gcc example.c -lDisk -lFS -L. -o example_name
