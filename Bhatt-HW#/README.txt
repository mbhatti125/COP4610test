Part 1

This program you will implement a command-line interpreter (a.k.a. a shell).
The shell operates in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to the prompt), the shellcreates a child process that executes the command you entered,
displays the output of the command, and then prompts for more user input when ithas finished.

To compile the program type the make command in the terminal. To execute the program use "./myshell" into the terminal.
This will start the program and the shell. Enter your commands after the prompt. Use an ampersand (&) after a command to have it run in the background. The process ID is printed.
Use semicolon (;) to have several commands run concurrently. The process IDs are printed. 

Examples of Commands: 

Exit the shell:
JohnSmith> quit

List files of the directory:
JohnSmith> /bin/ls
